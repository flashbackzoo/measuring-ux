# Measuring UX

Notes on the book Measuring the User Experience: Collecting, Analyzing, and Presenting Usability Metrics. Written by Tom Tullis and Bill Albert.

## What are UX metrics?

All UX metrics must be quantifiable - they have to be turned into a number or counted in some way.

They must also reveal something about the interaction between the user and the product. Some aspect of:

- Effectiveness. Being able to complete a task.
- Effciency. The ammount of effort required to complete a task.
- Satisfaction. The degree to which the user was happy with their experience while performing the task.

## Variables in user testing

The are two types of variables, independent and dependent. When designing a UX study you should have a clear idea of what your variables will be.

### Independent

Things you manipulate, designs, user demographic.

### Dependent

Things you measure, success rates, number of errors, user satisfaction.

## Data types

All variables can be measured using one of four data types:

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

### Nominal

Unordered list of groups or categories. For example - Windows users, Mac users, and Linux users. Or users in different geographical locations. One groups is not inherently better than another.

Typically independent variables used to segment data by different groups.

Individual groups can contain dependent variables. Such as task success, the number of user who clicked A vs B, errors encountered.

### Ordinal

Ordered list of groups or categories. For example - A user rating of excellent, good, fair, or poor. Or a user ranking a selection of designs in their prefered order.

The most common way to analyze ordinal data is 40% of users rate the site a excellent, 30% rate it good, 20% rate it fair, and 10% rate it poor.

The relative distances between each point is not meaningful. The design ranked 1st is not twice as good as the design ranked 2nd.

### Interval

See System Usability Scale (SUS).

### Ratio

A scale between two endpoints, where the distance between each endpoint is meaningful, and one endpoint is absolute zero. Time is an example of how ration data can be used in UX. Zero seconds left means a user has no time left to complete a task.

Ratio data can be used to say 'on average, users complete the task twice as fast, using design 2'.
